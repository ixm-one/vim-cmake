# vim-cmake

A new, next generation, CMake plugin for vim, because the one Kitware gives us
is broken.

## Roadmap

[ ] Generated syntax file from JSON
[x] Better highlighting settings
[ ] Configure and Build support
[ ] Automatic tag file generation
[ ] Support for using vscode cmake tool configuration files
[x] Support for reading IXM dict files

## Installation

Installation is fairly simple as with most other managers. It's available as
one package, so dump it into a directory and `packadd`, or use something like
[vim-plug][1]

```
<PluginManagerCommand> 'ixm-one/vim-cmake'
```
